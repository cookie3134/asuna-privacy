# Asuna Privacy
With "Asuna", "we", "our" are meant our Discord Inc. Discord Bot applications with the application id "791127836055699486"

# Data We Collect
We do not store any personal data with our Discord Bot. By starting the game, the bot briefly takes the avatar and the Discord user ID to display suitable statics such as name and avatar in the game message, but this is not stored but only briefly queried.

# Security
When we collect your information, we make all reasonable efforts to protect it from theft, loss, unauthorised access, disclosure, copying and use. Although we endeavour to keep the information you provide to us confidential, we must point out that no electronic data transmission or storage is 100% secure and no one can promise absolute data security. We will comply with the laws applicable to us in relation to any data breach. You are responsible for your choice of password and its overall security, as well as for the security of your own data within our services.
Only a few of our trusted service developers have access to your personal data.

# Children
Our Service is not directed directly to children under the age of 13 and/or children under the applicable digital consent age in your country, and we do not knowingly collect information from them.
If we determine that a person is under this age, we will block them from our service.

# Changes and Limits
We have the discretion to change our privacy policy to reflect updates to our business processes, current acceptable practices, or legal or regulatory changes. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post the changes here at the same link that you use to access this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to update our Privacy Policy at any time without notice.
